**Planar Mechanics**, also called **2D Kinematics**, **Planar Mechanism Analysis**, or **Two-Dimensional Machine Design**, is the branch of engineering that studies motion and force transmission in planar mechanical systems. This fundamental discipline provides the analytical foundation for designing precise, reliable mechatronic systems from robotic arms and manufacturing equipment to automated machinery and automotive components.

This course explores how mechanical systems move and transmit forces in two-dimensional space‚Äîknowledge essential for designing sophisticated mechatronic systems that require controlled motion, precise positioning, and optimized force transmission.
