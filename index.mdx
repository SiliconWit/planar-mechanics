**Planar Mechanics**, also called **2D Kinematics**, **Planar Mechanism Analysis**, or **Two-Dimensional Machine Design**, is the branch of engineering that studies motion and force transmission in planar mechanical systems. This fundamental discipline provides the analytical foundation for designing precise, reliable mechatronic systems from robotic arms and manufacturing equipment to automated machinery and automotive components.

This course explores how mechanical systems move and transmit forces in two-dimensional space—knowledge essential for designing sophisticated mechatronic systems that require controlled motion, precise positioning, and optimized force transmission.

## Lesson Structure & Approach

Each lesson follows our systems-based pedagogical approach:

<Steps>
1. **🔧 Real-World System Problem**
   Begin with complete mechatronic systems (robotic arms, manufacturing equipment, automotive systems) facing specific kinematic and dynamic challenges.

2. **📚 Fundamental Theory**
   Develop the mathematical and kinematic principles needed to analyze and solve the planar motion problem.

3. **🎯 System Application**
   Apply theory to the original system with step-by-step kinematic solutions and design verification.
